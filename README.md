# Aito example gallery

This repository contains the examples presented on our website [Aito.ai](https://aito.ai) showcases, blogs and tutorials.

All the released examples contain the steps for reproducing the results using Aito. We use live data sources for the
examples, so the results might differ slightly depending on when the data was fetched. In case the source data
format should change, we're happy to accept pull requests.

All the code and examples are licensed under the [Apache2 license](./LICENSE), except in cases where the original
data sources or libraries state otherwise. Exceptions like this are clearly marked in the code and/or the
examples and descriptions.

## All available examples

* [Find statistical relationships within traffic violations](./traffic-violations)
* [Predict missing values in Robot Framework](./robotframework-invoice)
* [Attended invoice form filling in Robot Framework](./robotframework-invoice-form)
* [Attended invoice form filling with Python and Selenium](./python-invoice-form)

We gladly accept requests for additional examples, if you have an idea on something you would like to see in our
gallery. Please create a pull-request with an example, an issue with an idea for one, or contact us using the
details found below.

## Trying out the examples

The examples come with some basic visualisations, but the underlying query is also available to try out directly.
You will need your own Aito instance and an API-key to be able to complete all the tasks. Sign up for [free Sandbox](https://aito.ai/sign-up/).
The raw request is visible (and copyable as a curl request, at least in Chrome), so you can adapt and run it in other tools as well.

Please note that the provided API-key does not allow modification of the data. If you wish to modify the data,
you can contact us for beta access to your own environment.
