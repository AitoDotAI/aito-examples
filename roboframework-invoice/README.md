# Machine Learning in Robot Framework

This example walks through how to implement machine learning predictions easily in [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/rpa/) RPA framework, using a purchase invoice dataset as an example. The use case is to predict missing datapoints in new invoices.

Step by step instructions are in the [blog post](https://aito.ai/blog/machine-learning-in-robot-framework/), please follow that in order to replicate this example.
